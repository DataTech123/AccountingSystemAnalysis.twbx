The project in the Excel file named "Cost Journal & Account Reconciliation" demonstrates my expertise in accounting concepts and processes, as well as my practical experience with accounting systems.
This project reflects my familiarity with accounting system information delivery to help in the design of financial dashboards for analysis using Tableau.

The purpose of this Tableau project is to fully manage accounting systems in various types of complex issues and problems in large-scale financial operations. 
It showcases a combination of my knowledge and experience in operational database design, updates, and Tableau dashboard design principles and processes.

Data Explanation:
In this project, I have defined and designed "only some elements of an accounting system,‚Äù in reference to my previous experience with accounting processes in SAP and Oracle suites.
For example, by exploring the "accountingsystemanalysis.twbx" DEMO, it consists of five financial dashboards that can resolve  common accounting operation problems. 
However, in a real-time working environment, I would directly connect or need to use ETL tools to extract data from the target system or data warehouse for the departmental multi-systems with the fact table analysis.


Thank you for reviewing my financial visualization design and the Cost Journal & Account Reconciliation in the Excel file.
I welcome any questions for further development.
